This repo contains the solution for the LongGÃ© project the course of [Internet Inside (EITN30)](https://www.eit.lth.se/index.php?ciuid=1392&coursepage=10001&L=1) at LTH. As a glimpse, the basic requirement is achieved by using the [forked driver of nRF24L01+ by TMRh20](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/). The IP layer is implemented with the library of [RF24Network](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24Network/) from the same author. Using this, we are able to achieve end-to-end bandwidth up to 1.05 Mbps, measured with iperf using udp.
