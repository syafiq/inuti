This repo contains the solution for the LongG\'e project the course of [Internet Inside (EITN30)](https://www.eit.lth.se/index.php?ciuid=1392&coursepage=10001&L=1) at LTH. As a glimpse, the basic requirement is achieved by using the forked driver of nRF24L01+ \cite{tmrh} by TMRh20. The IP layer is implemented with the library of RF24Network \cite{tmrhnet} from the same author. Using this, we are able to achieve end-to-end bandwidth up to 1.05 Mbps, measured with iperf using udp.
